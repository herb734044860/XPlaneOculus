XPlaneOculus
============

Download compiled builds of this project at [this project's website](http://runway12.com/projects/XPlaneOculus/).

A plugin for [X-Plane](http://www.x-plane.com) that adds support for head tracking with the [Oculus Rift](http://www.oculusvr.com) virtual reality HMD.

3D rendering for the rift is not currently supported. I'm using [Ibex](http://hwahba.com/ibex/) to convert the X-Plane window's image to the format needed by the rift for now. It's not a perfect solution at all, but it's good enough for initial development.

Support for rendering in stereo 3D with the correct dirstortion for the Oculus' optics is a planned area of research, but may not be possible from an X-Plane plugin. Positional headtracking using a head mounted Razer Hydra is also planned.

Things are in pretty rough shape right now. Expect things to get better and more documentation to come after a few more hours of hacking.
